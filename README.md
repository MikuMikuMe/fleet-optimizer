# fleet-optimizer

Creating a `fleet-optimizer` involves several components, including predictive maintenance and route optimization. Here, I'll provide a simplified example of how such a system might be structured using Python. This example will include mocks of predictive maintenance and route optimization logic, as a full implementation would be quite complex.

We'll assume the following for our simplified example:
- Predictive maintenance will identify if a vehicle needs maintenance based on a mock condition.
- Route optimization will compute the shortest route among a list of routes using a simple algorithm.

```python
import random
import logging

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id, maintenance_due_in):
        """Initialize a vehicle with an ID and days left for maintenance."""
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.maintenance_due_in = maintenance_due_in

    def needs_maintenance(self):
        """Determine if the vehicle needs maintenance."""
        return self.maintenance_due_in <= 0

class FleetOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the FleetOptimizer with a list of vehicles."""
        self.vehicles = []

    def add_vehicle(self, vehicle):
        """Add a vehicle to the fleet."""
        self.vehicles.append(vehicle)
        logging.info(f"Added vehicle {vehicle.vehicle_id} to fleet.")

    def predictive_maintenance_check(self):
        """Perform predictive maintenance checks on all vehicles."""
        try:
            for vehicle in self.vehicles:
                if vehicle.needs_maintenance():
                    logging.warning(f"Vehicle {vehicle.vehicle_id} requires maintenance!")
                else:
                    logging.info(f"Vehicle {vehicle.vehicle_id} is operational. Maintenance due in {vehicle.maintenance_due_in} days.")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error("An error occurred during predictive maintenance check: " + str(e))

    def route_optimization(self, routes):
        """Optimize and select the best route."""
        try:
            if not routes:
                raise ValueError("Route list is empty.")
                
            # Simplified route optimization: choose the shortest one
            optimized_route = min(routes, key=lambda x: x['distance'])
            logging.info(f"Optimized Route: {optimized_route['path']} with distance {optimized_route['distance']} km")
            return optimized_route
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error("An error occurred during route optimization: " + str(e))
            return None

def simulate_fleet_operation():
    """Simulate the operation of the fleet optimizer."""
    fleet_optimizer = FleetOptimizer()
    
    # Adding some mock vehicles to the fleet
    fleet_optimizer.add_vehicle(Vehicle(vehicle_id="V001", maintenance_due_in=5))
    fleet_optimizer.add_vehicle(Vehicle(vehicle_id="V002", maintenance_due_in=0))
    fleet_optimizer.add_vehicle(Vehicle(vehicle_id="V003", maintenance_due_in=3))

    # Run predictive maintenance check
    fleet_optimizer.predictive_maintenance_check()

    # Simulate route optimization
    routes = [
        {"path": "A-B-C", "distance": 50},
        {"path": "A-C", "distance": 30},
        {"path": "A-B-C-D", "distance": 60}
    ]
    
    fleet_optimizer.route_optimization(routes)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simulate_fleet_operation()
```

### Key Features:

1. **Vehicle Class**: Represents a vehicle, storing its ID and days until maintenance is due. Provides functionality to check if the vehicle requires maintenance.

2. **FleetOptimizer Class**: Manages a fleet of vehicles, handles predictive maintenance checks, and performs route optimization.

3. **Predictive Maintenance Check**: Simulated check based on due days for maintenance, with logging for different states.

4. **Route Optimization**: Simplified route optimization chooses the shortest path. In a real-world scenario, this could involve complex algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s or integration with mapping APIs.

5. **Error Handling**: The program includes basic error handling with logging to provide useful debug information in case of a failure.
